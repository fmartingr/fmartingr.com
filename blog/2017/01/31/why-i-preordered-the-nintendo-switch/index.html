          <p>As a gamer (<em>casual gamers have feelings too</em>) I pre-ordered the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/switch/">latest Nintendo Console</a> that will be launched on March 3rd worldwide. This post is an opinion and description of my gaming habits and why they fit with this new system.</p>

<h2 id="traveling-to-work-will-be-more-entertaining">Traveling to work will be more entertaining</h2><p>I end up using about 1h+ on weekdays just traveling from/to work; like 4-5% of the total time in a given day. A lot.</p>
<p>While on the train I usually read books or articles from my instapaper account but this may be the best way to also play a bit and distract myself. I gotta go to work anyway so let's spent that time even better!</p>
<h2 id="i-don-t-like-to-play-multiple-games-at-once">I don't like to play multiple games at once</h2><p><em>Once upon a time</em> I could just memorize everything I was doing in a given game and just remember it in the next play session, and if it still were that way this wont be a problem for me. Sadly I have to many things to keep track of already that <em>where I should return because there is a secret entrance covered by a rock I should be able to break later with a bomb</em> isn't one of them.</p>
<p>Having my 3DS for traveling and the PC or Wii U at home is a nuisance because this reason: keeping track of the progress of diferent stories is a pain, just like I don't read more than one book at a time.</p>
<p>The capabilities of the Switch for this are amazing because I can just play the same at home and outside it, both small and big screen.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2017/01/31/why-i-preordered-the-nintendo-switch/portability.jpg" alt="TV and Handheld modes"></p>
<h2 id="i-play-in-short-sessions">I play in short sessions</h2><p>Over time there are less and less gaming marathons mostly because I don't have enough time for them and the ones I still do are mostly because social gaming.</p>
<p>When I got distrated from work or need a rest or something I grab my Wii U and play a few levels for whatever game I had in that moment (for the curious, these days is <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-wii-u">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>).</p>
<p>After about 20-30 min I got tired or just think that is enough and I come back to my daily tasks or into more important things.</p>
<h2 id="i-like-nintendo-games-who-doesn-t">I like Nintendo games (<em>who doesn't?!</em>)</h2><p>With a few exceptions, most of the other system's AAA+ games are the typical that you find always in PC.</p>
<p>When looking for a system to get from the past generation I made a list of all the games that interested me and checked the top 10 games for every system. I ended up buying the Wii U because of that.</p>
<p>It's sad because the unique gaming styles that Nintendo create are usually only exploited by Nintendo itself.</p>

<h2 id="the-third-parties-have-no-excuses-now">The third parties have no excuses now</h2><p>This new console is more similar that the ones we already know: the user can play as if it were a <em>normal</em> system just with a screen and a gamepad (handheld or TV, don't care). There's no need to make up something new if they don't want to so they can just start creating or even porting old games.</p>
<p>Though I want to see how good and what developers achieve with that <em>HD Rumble</em>…</p>
<h2 id="conclusion/tl-dr">Conclusion / TL;DR</h2><p>I like the Switch, preordered it the moment it appeared on amazon, <del>even made a <a href="/nintendo-switch">page with a list of stuff you can preorder now</a> (99.9% Spanish sites, sorry!)</del>. There are a few friends that are getting it too and we united in a telegram channel to discuss about it and keep posting information as it releases.</p>
<p>Now I just need to wait for a month for it to arrive and tell you how amazed or dissapointed I am.</p>
