          <p>According to the Gregorian calendar, a new year is coming.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna waste my time -nor yours- making promises, wishing things and
all that crappy stuff. 2012 has been good and bad, I want 2013 to stay that
way, but I will keep that to me and I'm going to expose what I've thought
about the blog and what I want to do with it during 2013.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First of all, the <strong>#AppSunday</strong> thing: doing it. I've missed the last two because of the date and also I wasn't really in the mood to write a word either. I really want to do it, so I will keep writing a Sunday post about apps and stuff as long as I've something about to write.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As for <em>new technologies</em>, the reason I do not write too much about developing is because I do not think I'm a good programmer. I can't think I'm either good nor bad for something I <strong>love</strong>. I develop just because I enjoy it, as I've the bless that it's also my job. But after a lot of thinking, I'm going to post some micro-entries about new things I'm using -that could be things you already know long time ago- like PaaS services, libraries and stuff in general. I've a draft about <em>how to copy a mysql record with one SQL statement</em>, for example. If people like the posts as I like writing them, I will keep on with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also, this last year has been really… complete? I've started a lot of new projects -I really mean it, a lot of things whisper around my mind and some of it already have drafts and time invested on them-, so I've thought writing about its evolution. I don't know if I will make individual posts of each project or a weekly summary of all of them -or at least the ones I've worked that week-, but I want to share experiences, problems, solutions, technologies, <em>code</em>… with you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I still don't know if I will write personal experiences/opinion posts. I assumed that I will decide it when the time comes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There won't be a "What I've done in the last six months" post anymore. The one that is already in the blog will be purged when the translation is completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, get off the screen, eat a lot and get drunk. Today is the day.</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
