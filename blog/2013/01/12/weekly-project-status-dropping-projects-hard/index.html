          <p><img src="/blog/2013/01/12/weekly-project-status-dropping-projects-hard/weekly-project-status-banner.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I wrote <a href="http://fmartingr.com/blog/2012/12/31/2013/">the last post of
2012</a> I have been wondering if I
could finish -or at least, work- on all the projects or experiments I wanted
to. The answer was easy: <strong>no</strong>. I just don't have enough time for all the
stuff I want to do, so I have made some decisions about my projects.</p>
<h2 id="project-herobrine-dropped">Project <em>herobrine</em> <strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></h2><p><img src="/blog/2013/01/12/weekly-project-status-dropping-projects-hard/minecraft-database.png" alt="&quot;Early draft of Project
Herobrine&quot;"></p>
<p>The first time I did something about this project was like 2010, as some of
you have guessed by the name of the project, its minecraft related. It was
intended to be a <em>wowhead-like</em> minecraft database but not only on PC.</p>
<p>Some features I wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed with django, returning json objects to the client.</li>
<li>Client MVC based with BackboneJS</li>
<li>Responsive design -so you can check with your tablet while play on your computer-</li>
<li>"no refresh" -backbone-</li>
<li>WebGL/Canvas block rendering</li>
<li>JS Redstone circuit maker</li>
<li>JS Dye maker</li>
<li>Homepage with random background featuring user's screenshots (above)</li>
<li>Interactive crafting/brewing/…</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally I have to say goodbye to this <em>jewel</em> -and it's really hard because I
love minecraft and I wanted this to happen- because of various reasons:
<a href="http://minecraftwiki.net/">minecraftwiki</a> already contains a lot of
information -and it's really crowded-, the barrier of contents -I have to type
in all the minecraft items, blocks, biomes, etc- and that this wasn't really a
technical challenge -actually, some things are, but most of it are just
database relations and stuff-.</p>
<p>I want to prepare a future post with all the work I made on this project.
There's not much code but a lot of drafts and ideas that could help someone.</p>
<h2 id="project-serenity-dropped">Project <em>Serenity</em> <strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></h2><p>This was intended to be a way to simplify my jenkins business. Since I need a
lot of tasks like: compile, minify, copy, deploy, upload, test… I wanted an
app so I just define everything I need on a <em>YAML</em> file and call the app with
<code>serenity &lt;task&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I have some drafts built, a base YAML file, and some features planned like
integrated tasks, custom tasks in the YAML file, configuration…</p>
<p>Haven't coded for this one yet, but fortunately I heard about
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a> who may be something very close at what I wanted
this one to be.</p>
<h2 id="zombiepress-github-http//github-com/fmartingr/zombiepress/">ZombiePress (<a href="http://github.com/fmartingr/zombiepress/">github</a>)</h2><p><strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></p>
<p>It's obvious. I was making my own blog software but since now I'm a proud
octopress user this is no longer needed. I will keep the repo online just for
making me feel nostalgic in the future.</p>
<h2 id="bluebird-dropped">BlueBird <strong><em>…dropped!</em></strong></h2><p>For all the iPad users… remember when Twitter changed the UI of the app? Did
you remember the old one? I do. The new interface is <strong>total crap</strong>, the other
was simply brilliant, and for me it was near the best one for an iOS app. I
was hoping to get a clone working in javascript, but my knowledge of touch
screens is not that good, I need to study more on the matter and then<strong>maybe</strong>
I will try again, but I'm pretty sure some javascript guru will do something
before that happens.</p>
<h2 id="project-amaranth">Project <em>Amaranth</em></h2><p>The bigger brother. Recently I started a Vampire: Dark Age game with some
friends and it remembered me to when I played rolegames over IRC. I started
thinking that a online interface for roleplaying will be nice to have, because
you can also use it in a live session to whisper, draw, etc. The brainstorm
started quick enough for me to consider making it.</p>
<h2 id="project-rtc">Project <em>RTC</em></h2><p>Just born! -yesterday :P-. I want to make some kind of webRTC site to have
conversations without the need of register, just create a conversation, get a
link and you are set. It's more an experiment than a project itself.</p>
<h2 id="uvepe8-github-http//github-com/fmartingr/uvepe8/">Uvepe8 (<a href="http://github.com/fmartingr/uvepe8/">github</a>)</h2><p>I'm very proud -in a useful way- of this one and of course I'm maintaining it.</p>
<p>For the ones who don't know, its sort of <em>video-to-html5-canvas</em>, a mix
between apple's and sublime text's, but mines support transparency -I needed
it-.</p>
<p>There are some features I want to implement shown on the README file and a
full code review.</p>
<h2 id="dharma-github-http//github-com/fmartingr/dharma/">Dharma (<a href="http://github.com/fmartingr/dharma/">github</a>)</h2><p>An application to check for 404 links on websites, a lot of things could be
added to this, but for now is for playing around with threading, gevent and
that kind of things.</p>
<p>I have some <em>other things</em> in mind I want to try, but that deserves another
post -which is already in the works-.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, anything you want to say: comment,
tweet, mail or shout at me!</p>
