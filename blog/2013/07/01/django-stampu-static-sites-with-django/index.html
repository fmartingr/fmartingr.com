<blockquote><p>After finishing zombiepress a friend of mine wanted to use it but asked for
some kind of conversion to static since he uploads its current blog to github.
That's how this project was born.</p>

<p>Django as a static site? Of course, it's possible, only if your project it's
using a simple backend infrastructure, it doesn't let users modify the
database, and also doesn't have contact forms or that kind of stuff. The
conversion of a blog into static content was really easy, in about 30 minutes
I had an alpha working -which is the 0.1.2 version uploaded in github/pypi-.</p>
<p>django-stampu is basically a crawler. Some people led me to solutions much
more complicated. (Ex. Running a command and let the computer work.) And I
didn't like that. I wanted a conversion of the site as I see it when running
the <code>runserver</code> command, for that purpose you have to follow all the internal
links of the site and save the items as *.html if the content-type matches. It
also saves the static files in the site, but I need to look further into that,
because it can't save files needed by css files yet, it only checks for
src/href attributes on all tags in html files.</p>
<p>Want to try it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Install django-stampu: <code>pip install django-stampu</code></li>
<li>Add it to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code></li>
<li>Execute the command: <code>python manage.py stamp</code></li>
<li>Check the <code>_static</code> folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy, right? That's what I want to hear!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a proof of concept, I need to improve lots of things
and add some configuration variables for people that want to customize their
sites.</p>
