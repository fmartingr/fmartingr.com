<blockquote><p>Attention: This entry contains huge spoilers about the series finale of
Fringe. Also, lots of negative opinions, if you like the series or don't
understand how sarcasm works, leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've spent the last weeks watching the show from where I dropped it -the third
season- and I can say that the final season is the worst of all. I don't know
if the show was losing audicence, if they only wanted to finish it, because I
don't know another reason to kill the show this way.</p>
<p>From now on I'm talking only about the fifth season, as should be the more
important and the one all of you -and myself- have fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The most stupid thing I remember: The tapes with the plan to get rid of the observers.
Walter had a plan to defeat the observers, a plan that he never tell anyone
until is destroyed from his mind by an observer. But, hey! He must have
recorded the plan or something. I mean, he is a very smart one. He did. He
recorded that he have a plan on a tape, but for knowing what it is you have to
swim accross a sea of <em>amber</em> to find another eight tapes with the details. OH
HOW SMART IS THAT! Just a stupid reason to keep characters busy. Without this
the entire fifth season is done in two-three chapters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The observers powers.
So, I can read minds and predict -in some way- the future. How can SOMEONE
DEFEAT YOU IF YOU CAN PREDICT WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO. And more, you SAW in
Walter's mind what the plan was. The observers boss is just… asshole.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The plan.
Tons of VHS tapes with a specific plan of how to build a machine to generate a
wormhole, but in the last moment, hey! But the observers generate wormholes
for their supplies, let's use that! Let's put humanity's hope on a last moment
change! :D</p>
</li>
<li><p>Olivia's powers.
You used your last <em>cortexiphan</em> -or however it's written- on revive yourself
from a headshot (LOL), then you get injected fours times, each for every
dimension swap you have to do. Despite the fact that just this sucks, there's
more: William Bell needed a lot of time just to unleash her powers, and now,
is not that she have the powers <em>active</em>, but also she knows how to swap
dimensions on her own will. Fascinating. Also, from this point Olivia don't
need fear to use her powers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The observers chip.
Peter removes a chip from a observer and the observer die. Removes it from
himself and nothing happen. And I'm not talking about how deep the chip was
jumping insinde the brain when Walter did the tests… just WTF, die already.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gun's agains the observers.
This is just a little thing: in <em>our</em> universe, Bell design some improved guns
-that apparently only the rebels have 21 years in the future…- that shoots
faster to deal with the observers. When Olivia travels to the alternative
universe, they don't have that guns but can kill observers without a problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Time travel:
Apparently there's only one shot for a single one to time-travel: September
takes it. But when he's killed nothing prevents Walter for time traveling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Olivia vs. Observer Boss.
Apparently the energy needed to move a truck with the cortexiphan powers is
the electricity of the entire New York. That's efficient use of energy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more things, I'm sure, but I don't remember just now. Besides, there's
more than enough here.</p>
