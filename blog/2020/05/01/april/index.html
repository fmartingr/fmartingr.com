          <p>Weird month. It seems that quarantine finally caught up with me (and my
sleep schedule!). Since I cannot go to sleep when I want, I'm trying a
different approach... reading something at bed and waking up later. So
far so good.</p>
<p>This month I didn't read many articles/books (in fact, any book) but in
return I came back to reading some Manwha I had in my backlog. And I
have also invested some time in a few projects I'm currently
<em>incubating</em>.</p>
<p>I'm also on my way to self-host my own stuff, trying out software and
servers architectures so I can <em>dog-food</em> some of the stuff I use at
work, hopefully.</p>

<h2 id="tvshows/movies">TVShows/Movies</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>Money Heist</strong> (up to date)</p>
<p>This last season way less interesting than the others for my taste,
and they are extending this heist too much. It should had already
ended. But oh well...</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mandalorian</strong> (ongoing)</p>
<p>Started watching this on Disney+, of course I had to! I'm just a few
episodes in and so far I'm loving it. Star Wars universe for the win.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gravity Falls</strong> (finished)</p>
<p>I only watched this because a friend told me that it would diverge
into some Rick-and-Morty-like <em>shirt</em>. And it didn't. I'm dissapointed
at my friends now.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dragon Ball</strong> (ongoing)</p>
<p>I'm slowly going through this one since I only watch it while I cook.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Lion King (2019)</strong></p>
<p>Same old, same old. Why not? Environments are amazing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books-manwha">Books &amp; Manwha</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>The Magicians' Guild</strong> (<em>Trudi Canavan</em>)</p>
<p>Put on hold. Even though the book  was interesting enough I didn't
bring myself to continue reading it. In exchange...</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/dice/list?title_no=64&amp;page=1"><strong>DICE</strong></a> (ongoing)</p>
<p>I started <em>DICE</em> a long time ago, and it has been on my backlog for
the same period. Since I have a bit of IQ left at night, I gave it a
shot, and oh man, this one is <strong>good</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-gamer/list?title_no=88"><strong>The Gamer</strong></a> (ongoing)</p>
<p>This is esentially the <strong>exact same</strong> comment as above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2><p>There's no repository for this projects at the moment, I'm trying to
make projects public once I have something somewhat usable first,
so my accounts are not poluted with unfinished stuff. I will have my own
server for that soon™️.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Butter Robot</strong></p>
<p>On my current employeer we had the need of having some information
automatically posted in our channel reacting to different events. At
the beginning this was a simple python script reacting to a webhook
but as everything it has evolved. I'm making a simple bot framework
(Slack app &amp; telegram) to generate bots, trying to make it easily
extensible via plugins which are just python classes than can be
exposed to the main package using entry points.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Jeeves</strong></p>
<p>I started this some months ago, is an automated task manager via
configuration files. You define tasks on a pipeline and can execute
it via CLI/Server. There's few code and it does near to nothing (can
execute scripts and call docker containers), but I have plans to have
a server so triggers can be set, flows to execute several pipelines,
etc. This has been on my head for years, so glad it's finally taking
shape.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unnamed photo collection viewer</strong></p>
<p>I have been thinking about this for a while. There's no photo/video
management software that suit my needs right now, and even if there's
free/cheap alternatives out there I always have a copy of all my
collection just in case (you never know what could happen). So making
a viewer for all my collection should be the way to go, it wouldn't
have nice features (like automatic videos and all that stuff everyone
do nowadays) but I want a simple viewer, with a timeline, groups, that
 <em>do not edit</em> my files without my explicit permissio (because
 somtimes a wrong timezone or DST flag <em>fork</em> up a timeline).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="videogames">Videogames</h2><ul>
<li><p><a href="https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons"><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></a></p>
<p>My daily fix. I'm just doing some daily stuff, events and all little
by little. The 3DS version made me a hardcore player, so I'm taking
this one with more <em>zen</em>. It's really impressive how have they
improved this game.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://beta.playvalorant.com"><strong>Valorant</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/">Tabletop Simulator</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/468726/Tabletop_Simulator__Zombicide/">Zombicide DLC</a>)</strong></p>
<p>These two has been my social distancing vaccine for the month. We
continued with the Zombiecide campaigns and my friends and I managed
to get a Valorant beta from Twitch drops so I'm fragging like the
newbie I am.</p>

<p>Ow yes... How couldn't I see this coming. With this <em>#StayAtHome</em>
thingy my hype for this came back until I finally bought it. With
the system and all. I'm just a few days in and so far is awesome!
Just keep in mind that there are DLC blocking some summons and all
that, but going through the story again, with new graphics, 2020
cutscenes and characters have way more deep than in the vanilla
version... Right now I recommend it, but let's see what happens when
I finish it (or at least one third on the entire story...? Since this
is <strong>not</strong> the entire vanilla story)</p>
