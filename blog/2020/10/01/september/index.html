          <p><strong>Very</strong> cool month, finally managed to have some hard earned holidays! I had the privilege of
going with some friends (even some I hadn't seen in a long time!) to an apartment near the beach,
and oh boy did I need that. I came back fully charged! Apart from that, not much movement in any
area.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2><p>I have <em>refactored</em> my local network a bit, bought a proper router with integrated firewall and monitoring,
and a new AP to get along with that. Next step will be re-creating my entire home-assistant instance from
scratch on a new raspberry pi. With that I will start a blog post series on every step I'm going to take,
sort of a tutorial sort of informative. You can do very cool things with it.</p>
<p>Not much time for anything else.</p>

<p>I read only a little more, either the good is not as impacting as the first one (it isn't) or
I'm completely gone with my reading habits again. I though I would enjoy this on my vacation time, but
I didn't end up hooked. I will probably drop this one, sadly.</p>

Tried starting with Mario 64 first, but the camera and controls were so frustrating I ended up skipping it
and going directly to Sunshine. I've collected a few stars but I haven't sit down properly to get with it,
only playing on spare time between other things.</p>
