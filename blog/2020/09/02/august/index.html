          <p>Slowly going back to routine, this month has been well spent going out when possible and spending
time with friends and family, a thing that we couldn't do properly for some time now. Not much
"progress" on anything else for that matter.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2><p>Didn't have much time to play around with projects this time, but in simple terms I've managed to
release the code for <a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/butterrobot">butterrobot</a> for anyone to see
and shame my code and prepared the slack application for my team to use. I'll admit that is a bit
of a pain to play with several repositories at the same time, and github doesn't make this easy on
itself requiring authentication for the container registry... but well, so far it's working and
it's good to have room for improvement.</p>
<p>I've also received my <a href="https://firewalla.com/">Firewalla Gold</a> and finally finished tidying up
my network infrastructure a bit, though it will require a bit more tuning but at least I can now
focus on what I've been eager to do: setup my home assistant for all the devices and automations
on my home, yay!</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2><ul>
<li><p>Started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51901147-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes"><strong>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Prequel to the Hunger Games, seems like a short enough book to get back with my reading habits again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2><ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.assemblegame.com"><strong>Assemble with care</strong></a>: Played this on my phone and it was a short but
wonderful playthrough. It's a story-driven puzzle game, though puzzles are very easy since they are
secondary. Full voice acting makes this a calm and relaxing experience to do while on the move (or at
the beach!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/900270/Reventure/"><strong>Reventure</strong></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2><p>Mostly videos this time around, since I'm used to put something off-screen while I'm working. Some interesing stuff in
there, mostly videogame related.</p>
