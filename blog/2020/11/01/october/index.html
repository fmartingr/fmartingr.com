<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2><p>I have started my slow journey into Golang and spend an skill boost day at work doing some stuff with it. Ended up
with a lot of tabs open but it was the most fun I have had for a while! If you're curious the result is on my
<a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/gurl">gurl repository</a>, it's not complete (or useful) by any means, but I want to
expand it with new <em>features</em> while I learn some more.</p>
<p>In my spare time I've been working on a simple program to manage my game's screenshots, I have a lot over several
computers/operating systems and I want to organize them better to publish them on an online gallery. I'm starting
to enjoy Go quite a bit the more I do with it, even if it's only minor stuff.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224"><strong>The social dilemma</strong></a></p>
<p>An interesting movie/documental about how social networks are not our friends. They didn't provide me with
anything I didn't knew, but should be interesting for less <em>techy</em> people to watch and understand they are
the product.</p>

<p>Our new show for lunch/dinner/off time. Player 2 totally loves this and was very happy to know we could watch
it in order, since on the TV Channels they emit it here episodes seem to be randomized for some reason, so you
could watch an episode of the second season followed by another from the last one.</p>

<h2 id="games">Games</h2><ul>
<li><p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/es-es/product/EP0082-CUSA07187_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000"><strong>Final Fantasy VII: Remake</strong></a></p>
<p>I finally put an end to it. <a href="/blog/2020/10/15/final-fantasy-vii-remake-my-review/">My review in a separate post</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/Programas-descargables-Nintendo-Switch/A-Short-Hike-1821799.html"><strong>A Short Hike</strong></a></p>
<p>A short (as the name implies) adventure of the path to hike a mountain and all the people you met in between. Love the art style and the simplicity of the game.
Liked the idea of having the achievements directly on the switch too, in-game. (I miss that from Steam on the Switch)
I'm a fan of this kind of games you can enjoy and put an end to them in a few hours.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/"><strong>Terraria</strong></a></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020/11/01/october/terraria.jpg" alt="My terraria state"></p>
<p>We managed to <strong>complete it</strong>. Which in our case meant getting al achievements. It was a really fun
ride! This game is easily one of my favourites and for the price you can get it is completely a must, you get
an incredible amount of content and entertainment, better played with friends!</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/"><strong>Starbound</strong></a></p>
<p>Terraria, but in <strong>space</strong>! And I have a MECH!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020/11/01/october/starbound.jpg" alt="My mech in Starbound"></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/Programas-descargables-Nintendo-Switch/Graveyard-Keeper-1579157.html"><strong>Graveyard Keeper</strong></a></p>
<p>Got this for the Switch because it was supposed to be more linear and light than Stardew Valley, but upon
starting I got tons of things to do and it got a bit overwhelming for me right now, wanted something more
lightweight to play at the moment. On hold for now.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1425380"><strong>10 mg :)</strong></a></p>
<p>This is a really small game (10mg stands for 10 minute games) as a tribute to the arcade classics with some kind of twist.
I got near 20 minutes of gameplay from this and it was fun to go through it :)</p>
