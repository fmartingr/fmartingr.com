<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2><ul>
<li><p>Fosdem 2020 <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-link fosdem 2020"><a href="#fn-link fosdem 2020">1</a></sup></p>
<p>We were nearby for DevConf so we just went a few days here. I forgot
how packed and difficult going to some tracks is... but we managed
to attend some interesting talks and meet with some friends there,
which is always a plus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tvshows/movies">TVShows/Movies</h2><ul>
<li><p>Finished watching Friends, again. It was so my player 2 and I had a
20m episode series to watch at lunch/dinner. It still make me laugh.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finished watching The Good Place <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-show2"><a href="#fn-show2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Interesting show. The first season is what I liked the most, and
the show is a good overall to watch while eating or something,
short episodes (~20m), comical and with good actors. The show
mocks humanity in every way possible, the sad part is that most
of that is totally true! The ending kinda surprised me and made
me think a little bit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Started watching Money Heist <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-show3"><a href="#fn-show3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>We flew through the entire first season in a flash, and we're now on
the second (which it doesn't seem as good as the first). I liked the
first one a lot, even if there were some stuff that didn't make much
sense. Totally recommended.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2><ul>
<li><p>Finished reading The last wish <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-book1"><a href="#fn-book1">4</a></sup> by <em>Andrzej Sapkowski</em></p>
<p>As many people I started reading this after watching the TV Show (but
haven't played the game yet).</p>
<p>I was scared that it would be too similar to I was already seen but to
my surprise, even though some of the events tell the "same story" (on
a sense) are different enough from what I saw on TV.</p>
<p>I did enjoy it though it was short in length, but in exchange you
don't necessarily need to continue reading the rest of the books if
you don't want to (right away) because it contains a tale per chapter
that even if they are a full story when read in full it doesn't put
the reader in a position where it needs to read the rest.</p>
<p>I recommend it if you like the fantasy genre, is a light read, short
and self-contained.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Started reading The Magicians' Guild <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-book2"><a href="#fn-book2">5</a></sup> by <em>Trudi Canavan</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="videogames">Videogames</h2><ul>
<li><p>Started and quickly dropped (and refunded) Warcraft 3: Reforged
<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-game1"><a href="#fn-game1">6</a></sup></p>
<p>I didn't manage to finish the "classic" Warcraft 3 back in the day, so
even after the critics and so on I decided to give it a go. Huge
mistake. The game is not prepared for wide-screens, it doesn't help
that the UI covers most of the screen either, my units keep getting
stuck on trees around and the game crashed on me a few times (and I
only played the tutorial and one scenario). My first though was...
well, since I have the classic one on my account let's just play
that... but no, the classic version now download the Reforged game
with the classic graphic pack. Even if you are a HUGE Warcraft fan,
you shouldn't pay for this. Luckily Blizzard knows and they do instant
refunds for the game.</p>
<p>Blizzard, please release classic Warcraft III on Good Old Games as
you've done with the two previous entries. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-gog-war1-2-bundle"><a href="#fn-gog-war1-2-bundle">7</a></sup> I just
bought and downloaded them just in case you decide to <em>Reforge</em>
everything. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-gog-petition-w3"><a href="#fn-gog-petition-w3">8</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>Started and dropped Assasin's Creed Origins <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-game2"><a href="#fn-game2">9</a></sup></p>
<p>I was in the mood of playing some of these open world games, and I had
this in my uPlay account already waiting as a gift for purchasing an
nvidia graphics card. The game looked good but it seems it was
horribly optimized since I had constant frame drops and AI glitches.
I tried some stuff to make it better but nothing worked. It killed the
inmersion so much that I just uninstalled it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Started playing Wolcen <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-game3"><a href="#fn-game3">10</a></sup></p>
<p>To play with some friends (though I've played mainly by myself because
of schedule issues). It's an action RPG that aims to be good, but
has still some bugs (it released this month).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Played some Clash Royale <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-game4"><a href="#fn-game4">11</a></sup> and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp
<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-game5"><a href="#fn-game5">12</a></sup> on mobile.</p>
<p>The first one just because, the other because of the hype of the next
Animal Crossing game releasing soon for the Switch.</p>

<li><p>Why Discord is switching from Go to Rust <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-article2"><a href="#fn-article2">14</a></sup></p>

developers used to do to accomodate to old hardware. Really
interesting.</p>
