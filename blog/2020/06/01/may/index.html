          <p>I can go out now. In those rare days with good weather here I can
take pictures like this.</p>

<li><p><strong>Mandalorian</strong> (ongoing)</p>
<p>I say ongoing, but I think I have not watched it this month... the thing
is that I still have to finish it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rick and Morty</strong> (ongoing)</p>
<p>Of course I'm up to date, don't be <em>rickdiculous</em>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Once upon a time</strong> (ongoing)</p>
<p>To kill time during lunch/dinner because my Player 2 likes it. Pretty
boring though. Only the first season is "good" in some way because the
premise is interesting, after that it all goes to <em>shirt</em>.</p>

<p>And I have the urge to read <em>One Piece</em> but don't know from where
(legally) withouth investing a lot in physical copies...</p>
<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1><p>Little progress on code this month, just making some tests and
concepts (because <em>Memories</em> required front-end work and I forgot
almost everything I knew about CSS).</p>
<p>Spent some time reworking my local infra from scratch. All the
services I had running were done with poorly manual labor and now I'm
working on provisioning everything using Ansible. I have to do the same
for my computers since I'm planning the new dotfiles from scratch too.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jeeves</strong></p>
<p>Very little progress, just added a few tasks and so, the example here
is not working because docker is broken on my machine at the time of
writing, but it should work. Promise.</p>
<p>My problem with this is that until it has a proper server to trigger
tasks via webhooks, crons or other methods is just a lightweight
(and worst) Ansible <em>wannabe</em>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Butterrobot</strong></p>
<p>Spent some time refactoring code and thinking on what to use for
a simple admin interface to setup new features for the bots, enable or
disable plugins and all that.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020/06/01/may/butterrobot.png" alt="Butterrobot !dice plugin"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Memories</strong> (previously <em>Unnamed photo viewer</em>)</p>
<p>Worked on reading the files from the filesystem and extracting the
mininmum required metadata for me to save on the database (to have
some search/filters going on). Also got some ideas depending on how the
files are stored (use folder names as "tags" to search for example).</p>
<p>Also played around with thumbnails, which are tricky to do depending on
the file, and I have a lot of variety (from standard JPEG to HEIC going
through 360 videos, etc.). I also noticed that I have a lot of files
with wrong metadata, which does <strong>not</strong> help at all with my testing.</p>
<p>Well, I have a simple frontend now, but everything is a very work in
progress (and those menu links are just dummy navigation).</p>
<p>I need to focus on implement a proper backend and decide on the main
features to implement in the first release, which should come with a
simple frontend and API for people to create their own.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons"><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></a></p>
<p>Just a daily routine trying to complete the monthly <em>citteropedia</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/es-es/product/EP0082-CUSA07187_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000"><strong>Final Fantasy VII: Remake</strong></a></p>
<p>I think I'm almost through the end, just finishing up some side quests
prior to the final chapters. I'm having lots of fun, probably
because the slow pace so I don't finish it in just a few days.</p>
<p>I can't describe how awesome the soundtrack is, specially with the
nostalgia effect from the original.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/"><strong>Terraria</strong></a></p>
<p>The last update for Terraria came out this month and I'm going through
the content with a friend trying to go though all the content. Well,
not <em>all</em> content, since there is <strong>a lot</strong>. This game is a piece of
art, one of those rare gems that I wish I had more time to properly
enjoy it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/466560/Northgard/"><strong>Northgard</strong></a></p>
<p>This has been on my Steam library for quite some time, and since the
Valhalla announcement I had the urge to play something Viking related.
Didn't play much (two scenarios I think). Is a fairly nice strategy
game but it has enough elements to make it enjoyable for a player like
me (because I'm not very good at them).</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/Programas-descargables-Nintendo-Switch/Minecraft-Dungeons-1749059.html"><strong>Minecraft Dungeons</strong></a>:</p>
<p>Got this for the switch because I wanted to have something to spend a
few minutes in and kill some time and couldn't I be more worng.</p>
<p>My surprise has been the awful load times (2m+ to start playing from
the Switch main menu), sub-30 framerates and the awesome chance of the
game crashing when putting the console in sleep mode. The game is
<em>fun</em> to play from time to time (and I'm sure is way more fun in
multiplayer) but the Switch version is just so bad that no one should
buy it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/"><strong>Sea of Thieves</strong></a> and <a href="https://beta.playvalorant.com"><strong>Valorant</strong></a> with friends to keep me close while social distancing, though I'm not sure I would keep playing since rebooting to Windows just to play some games is itching me a lot lately, rather buy what I can play on Linux and purchasing the rest on Switch or PS4 if needed.</p>
