          <p>I've finally started to play with K3S, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. I have been reading about it for a while and I'm excited to see how it performs in my home lab. My services have been running in an Intel NUC running Docker container for some years now, but the plan is to migrate them to a k3s cluster of three NanoPC-T6 boards.</p>
<p>I was looking for a small form-factor and low power consumption solution, and the NanoPC-T6 seems to fit the bill. I know I'm going to stumble upon some limitations but I'm eager to see how it goes and the problems I find along the way.</p>
<p>My requirements are very simple: I want to run a small cluster with a few services, and I want to be able to access them from the internet and from my home. My current setup relies on Tailscale for VPN and Ingress for the services, so I'm going to try and replicate that in this new setup.</p>

          <p>Due to some recent traveling I have started to listen to audiobooks. I love reading but some times my eyes are just too tired to go with it but I'm not sleepy at all or maybe I just wanted the convenience to lay down but still <em>do</em> something.</p>
<p>Short story, I bought some from a known distributor but I'm a fan of data preservation and actually owning what I pay for. I found an application in Github that allowed me to download the files that composed the audiobook in split mp3 files, but that didn't do. I wanted a single file with correct metadata, so I got my hands dirty.</p>

<p>First weekend of February was, as usual, the FOSDEM conference in Belgium, and I could not miss it. I started attending a few years back, and since then I have tried going if my schedule allowed it.</p>
<p>This is a super brief summary of my experience during the event on the two days I was there, though this year I left early on Sunday before the conference properly finished so Sunday was a bit more scarce. A lot of unattended talks from the agenda too, I have a <strong>huge</strong> backlog of videos to watch now.</p>

          <p>I'm too joining this trend, since it seems like a good idea to keep track of the tools I use, others may discover new ones as I have done in people lists, and it's a good way to see how my preferences change over time.</p>
<p>Here's my list for this year:</p>

</table><p>The last <em>Secret Novel</em> from <em>Brandon Sanderson</em>, titled <em>The Sunlit Man</em> (or <em>El hombre iluminado</em> in Spanish, the version I read). This is the most Cosmere focused novel of the four, with a lot of references to <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> series; or at least I guess so, since I haven't read any books from that series yet, though some names feel familiar.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed it, just not as much as the others to be honest. I liked the environment a lot and the idea of <span class="spoiler">a planet that can kill you easily</span> and what that means for the population of the planet, their livelihood, their interactions, ... In the end is a Space Opera <em>ala Sanderson</em>, and I don't know if I just got spoiled with <em>Tress of the Emerald Sea</em> (my favorite of the three) that I just wanted something as different. and this one being the most similar to the novels I already read from Sanderson just made it a little worse for me.</p>
<p>Even with that, I recommend fantasy/sci-fi lovers a read; it's just around 500 pages of non-stop movement, you get to the heart of the story pretty quickly and from there is just non-stop movement until you get to the outcome in the final two-three chapters.</p>
<p>And with this, the <a href="https://www.dragonsteelbooks.com/collections/the-year-of-sanderson">year of Sanderson</a> is over.</p>
