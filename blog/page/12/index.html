          <p>It's sad but I always end up not writing in the blog for some reason. I will
post here a short TL;DR of what happened in the last months and some of the
stuff I want to do for the site (and what I've already done).</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, I got promoted at my job (this was like... months ago!) which left me with even less time that before for personal stuff. I can't believe I'm saying this but when I get out of the office the last thing I want to do is sitting in front of my computer again.</li>
<li>Good part, I have been trying all the stuff at work I couldn't before and adding goodies to the dev team (automatic code reviews, unit testing, deployments, etc)</li>
<li>Bad stuff: now I develop less than before. :_</li>
<li>Also, I wasn't comfortable with how the editor on the site worked (it's a CKEditor) because I'm a big fan of markdown so I wasn't eager to do nothing until some day I did a clumsy implementation to support markdown conversion to HTML to the blog. <a href="https://trello.com/b/QgoVFfl2/fmartingr-com">I also added some other goodies</a>.</li>
<li>More stuff to the mix? I got pretty much overwhelmed with all the things I had to/want to/should do on a daily basis so my workflow was chaotic. I have been trying new habits to sort everything out and now I'm more or less comfortable with the results. And I will write an entry about that :)</li>
<li>Related with the last one now I'm not giving up on reading all the stuff in "the read later vault" which until not so long ago was filled with diverse stuff and articles came in but not out.</li>
<li>I play a bit now! Since I have thoughts and days in order now I can rest from time to time to play some videogames. It was time to remove the dust from my 3DS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Discovered it not a long time ago (and now replaced with the experimental
version of iterm2 <a href="https://iterm2.com/features.html">because of goodies</a>),
tmux deserves a lot of attention because it have lots of potential.</p>
<p>TMUX stands for Terminal Multiplexer. <em>It lets you switch easily between
several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the
background) and reattach them to a different terminal. And do a lot more.</em>
Yeah, they sell themselves well.</p>
<p>For the novices, it lets you have panels (split terminals) and windows just
with some keybinds, detaching from them (so they keep running) and with the
possibility of storing configurations for certain tasks, in which you need to
open a running server and editor and some watcher at the same time, just with
a command.</p>
<p>For example, if you are like in the top screenshot, pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>b</code> <code>%</code>
<code>CTRL</code>+<code>b</code> <code>"</code> changes the layout to this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2015/08/04/tmux-basics/tmux-horver.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And those numbers with a tilde at the bottom? The open windows. You can open
more pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>b</code> <code>c</code>, like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2015/08/04/tmux-basics/tmux-window.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This are the two basic things you will use everyday. Of course, there are
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-
current/man1/tmux.1?query=tmux&amp;sec=1">more stuff you can do</a>, but for the basics I will list the more
frequent keybinds here to start using it right now.</p>

          <p>They tricked me.</p>
<p>I was confortably on my Atom editor when I had to open this ugly thing.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2015/07/23/emacs-day-zero/emacs-original.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I'm trying to make the change. Also, to make things easier I switched my
layout to US since all my servers have that keyboard layout but... my muscle
memory is really good, so I still miss a lot.</p>
<p>After a basic configuration yesterday, I thought that the best way to achieve
this was to change completely from one to another and that's what I've done,
work the entire day with this. At first I was slowed down a bit because I had
to configure some keybinding I was used to and install the basic addons I use
the most (and setup them emacs style), but after a short period I was <em>mostly</em>
used to the harm of my little finger. It still hurts.</p>
<p>It's a long way to go and this is only day zero but I will keep writing posts
every one or two weeks with my improvements as a newbie guide to emacs.</p>
<p>Also, my UI now looks <em>more or less</em> like this:</p>
