          <p>I started the out of pure hype and even bought -again- a PlayStation 4 in the process, but haven't finished it until recently due to time constraints, lack of interest and having lost the initial momentum.</p>
<p>I will try to to a quick review of what I feel playing it and if there's something spoilery it will be obscured to avoid accidents; same with the pictures.</p>

          <p><strong>Very</strong> cool month, finally managed to have some hard earned holidays! I had the privilege of
going with some friends (even some I hadn't seen in a long time!) to an apartment near the beach,
and oh boy did I need that. I came back fully charged! Apart from that, not much movement in any
area.</p>

          <p>Slowly going back to routine, this month has been well spent going out when possible and spending
time with friends and family, a thing that we couldn't do properly for some time now. Not much
"progress" on anything else for that matter.</p>

          <p>Summer is here!</p>
<p>Even without restrictions or quarantine is has been a weird month. Cases here are going up and down,
I don't want to go back to the gym (and I think I won't until next year), some restaurants and cafe
have closed permanently and the ones that are still standing are usually full (which is good). We're
just trying to go back to normal, step by step, and having some friends stay at home a few days
helped a lot.</p>

          <p>We can travel now! Quarantine restrictions have been raised here, and we can go visit family. It's weird
seeing people with masks, cleaning its hands and so on (though not everyone eveytone). It gives me some Japan
nostalgia.</p>
<p>It hasn't been a productive month, and I don'tknow where time went. And that made me realize that I can't
do everything I want to do... I have to start dropping tasks from all kinds of hobbies and organize myself
<strong>way</strong> better. That is my homework for this summer.</p>
