          <p>According to the Gregorian calendar, a new year is coming.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna waste my time -nor yours- making promises, wishing things and
all that crappy stuff. 2012 has been good and bad, I want 2013 to stay that
way, but I will keep that to me and I'm going to expose what I've thought
about the blog and what I want to do with it during 2013.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First of all, the <strong>#AppSunday</strong> thing: doing it. I've missed the last two because of the date and also I wasn't really in the mood to write a word either. I really want to do it, so I will keep writing a Sunday post about apps and stuff as long as I've something about to write.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As for <em>new technologies</em>, the reason I do not write too much about developing is because I do not think I'm a good programmer. I can't think I'm either good nor bad for something I <strong>love</strong>. I develop just because I enjoy it, as I've the bless that it's also my job. But after a lot of thinking, I'm going to post some micro-entries about new things I'm using -that could be things you already know long time ago- like PaaS services, libraries and stuff in general. I've a draft about <em>how to copy a mysql record with one SQL statement</em>, for example. If people like the posts as I like writing them, I will keep on with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also, this last year has been really… complete? I've started a lot of new projects -I really mean it, a lot of things whisper around my mind and some of it already have drafts and time invested on them-, so I've thought writing about its evolution. I don't know if I will make individual posts of each project or a weekly summary of all of them -or at least the ones I've worked that week-, but I want to share experiences, problems, solutions, technologies, <em>code</em>… with you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I still don't know if I will write personal experiences/opinion posts. I assumed that I will decide it when the time comes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There won't be a "What I've done in the last six months" post anymore. The one that is already in the blog will be purged when the translation is completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, get off the screen, eat a lot and get drunk. Today is the day.</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012/12/20/howto-os-x-screenshots-without-shadows/">HowTo: OS X screenshots without shadows</a></h1>
    <div class="info">
      Published on December 20, 2012
    </div>
    
      <div class="content">
        
        
          <p>The beautiful shadows that OS X brings to screenshots are good in some ways or
depending the purpose of the screenshot itself. But for other things are a
pain in the ass.</p>
<p>After some research I've found multiple ways to get rid of that shadows</p>
<h2 id="1-the-default-setting">1) The default setting</h2><p>Since the terminal command allows you to deactivate the shadow I assumed that
there could be some <code>defaults</code> option for the same purpose. And it is!</p>
<p>With this two commands you can use the normal keybinds to do <em>shadowless</em>
screenshots:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true killall SystemUIServer`
</pre></div>
<p>To revert to the original status:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool false killall SystemUIServer
</pre></div>
<h2 id="2-the-grab-utility">2) The Grab utility</h2><p>Open the Grab.app: <code>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Grab</code>, and under the <code>Capture</code>
menu you will find the <code>Window</code> option.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>SHIFT</code>+<code>CMD</code>+<code>W</code> keybind -while Grab.app is focused-.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-terminal-way">3) The terminal way</h2><p>OS X provides us with the <code>screencapture</code> command, so we can hack around and
build our own scripts. A simple one that allows interactive capture without
shadow:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>screencapture -i -o filename.png
</pre></div>
<p>A more complete one that saves the screenshot on the desktop with the datetime
as filename:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>screencapture -i -o ~/Desktop/screenshot_`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`.png
</pre></div>
<p>These are some ways I found. You can play around and make your own bash or
Automator scripts and improve it to your needs.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012/11/23/amazon-s3-bucket-public-read-policy/">Amazon S3 bucket public read policy</a></h1>
    <div class="info">
      Published on November 23, 2012
    </div>
    
      <div class="content">
        
        
          <p>After migrating the blog to a PaaS service I had a proble that the disk space
was volatile and I had to store the images and binary files on another server
or CDN. After thinking for a while I decied to give a try to amazon S3.</p>
<p>Created a bucket that I'm going to use as CDN for now on, but geeking around I
saw that the permissions are modified by file, not by folder/bucket. Searching
aroung the docs I found the policies, that are JSON strings wich include
properties for the entire bucket.</p>
<p>For making a read-only public bucket you need this:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s2">&quot;Version&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;2008-10-17&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s2">&quot;Statement&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;Sid&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;AllowPublicRead&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;Effect&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Allow&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;Principal&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="s2">&quot;AWS&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">},</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;Action&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;s3:GetObject&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;Resource&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;arn:aws:s3:::/*&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Replace &lt;bucket name&gt; for yours and apply changes. With this the entire
bucket will be publicy accesible, but if you want to be more restrictive, you
may specify a subfolder:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot;Resource&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;arn:aws:s3:::&lt;bucket&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/*&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
