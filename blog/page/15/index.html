<blockquote><p>After finishing zombiepress a friend of mine wanted to use it but asked for
some kind of conversion to static since he uploads its current blog to github.
That's how this project was born.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Django as a static site? Of course, it's possible, only if your project it's
using a simple backend infrastructure, it doesn't let users modify the
database, and also doesn't have contact forms or that kind of stuff. The
conversion of a blog into static content was really easy, in about 30 minutes
I had an alpha working -which is the 0.1.2 version uploaded in github/pypi-.</p>
<p>django-stampu is basically a crawler. Some people led me to solutions much
more complicated. (Ex. Running a command and let the computer work.) And I
didn't like that. I wanted a conversion of the site as I see it when running
the <code>runserver</code> command, for that purpose you have to follow all the internal
links of the site and save the items as *.html if the content-type matches. It
also saves the static files in the site, but I need to look further into that,
because it can't save files needed by css files yet, it only checks for
src/href attributes on all tags in html files.</p>
<p>Want to try it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Install django-stampu: <code>pip install django-stampu</code></li>
<li>Add it to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code></li>
<li>Execute the command: <code>python manage.py stamp</code></li>
<li>Check the <code>_static</code> folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy, right? That's what I want to hear!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a proof of concept, I need to improve lots of things
and add some configuration variables for people that want to customize their
sites.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute in any way, you can <a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/django-stampu">check the source code at
github</a>.</p>

          <p>It finally happened. I got tired of octopress and decided to finish what I
started: my own blogging CMS.</p>
<p>It's a really modest thing built with django. I've added some thing to make it
easy to use (in my oppinion):</p>
<ul>
<li>settings.py main preferences (required for running the app) are set on environment variables instead of environment dependant settings files or the not so cool local_settings.py.</li>
<li>A a key-&gt;value preferences config in the admin (<a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/zombiepress/blob/master/zombiepress/apps/config/models.py#L5">a simple django model with 3 fields</a>) for settings that may be needed to modify in a live environment and would be a shame if it were on the <em>settings.py</em> file. In example, I use it to <a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/zombiepress-fmartingr-theme/blob/master/blog/rss.jinja2#L4-L6">set some RSS preferences</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/zombiepress-fmartingr-theme/blob/master/blog/entry.jinja2#L62-L65">Disqus shortname for the blog comments</a>. To disable blog comments I just need to uncheck the "pass to template" option on the required variable.</li>
<li>Theming: Not an absolute state of the art, but it's function works: a themes folder and a variable to select one on the settings.py, I just need to create the basic theme.</li>
<li><strong>(experimental)</strong> Multilanguage support. A friend asked for a easy to use CMS with multilingual support, so I want to give it a shot. Since I never used django with managed multilingual content, it may be easy or it may be not. The code is there, someone has to try it.</li>
</ul>

          <p>Recently I've started the migration of my company's servers to a new provider.
After checking that the OS installed on the -now- old servers was Ubuntu 8.04
(holy shit), I decided to make a fresh install of CentOS 6.3, cleaning up all
the servers contents and setting up everything from scratch.</p>
<p>After setting my iptables rules (INPUT whitelisted, OUTPUT accept all) I
noticed a big delay on every connection made to my server. After checking a
lot of things, these two solved the issue:</p>
<h2 id="enable-unilimited-traffic-on-your-loopback-interface">Enable unilimited traffic on your loopback interface</h2><div class="hll"><pre><span></span>iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
</pre></div>
<h2 id="enable-traffic-for-connections-started-by-your-server">Enable traffic for connections started by your server</h2><div class="hll"><pre><span></span>iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
</pre></div>
<p>Hope this solves your issue as it did with mine.</p>

<blockquote><p>Attention: This entry contains huge spoilers about the series finale of
Fringe. Also, lots of negative opinions, if you like the series or don't
understand how sarcasm works, leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've spent the last weeks watching the show from where I dropped it -the third
season- and I can say that the final season is the worst of all. I don't know
if the show was losing audicence, if they only wanted to finish it, because I
don't know another reason to kill the show this way.</p>
<p>From now on I'm talking only about the fifth season, as should be the more
important and the one all of you -and myself- have fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The most stupid thing I remember: The tapes with the plan to get rid of the observers.
Walter had a plan to defeat the observers, a plan that he never tell anyone
until is destroyed from his mind by an observer. But, hey! He must have
recorded the plan or something. I mean, he is a very smart one. He did. He
recorded that he have a plan on a tape, but for knowing what it is you have to
swim accross a sea of <em>amber</em> to find another eight tapes with the details. OH
HOW SMART IS THAT! Just a stupid reason to keep characters busy. Without this
the entire fifth season is done in two-three chapters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The observers powers.
So, I can read minds and predict -in some way- the future. How can SOMEONE
DEFEAT YOU IF YOU CAN PREDICT WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO. And more, you SAW in
Walter's mind what the plan was. The observers boss is just… asshole.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The plan.
Tons of VHS tapes with a specific plan of how to build a machine to generate a
wormhole, but in the last moment, hey! But the observers generate wormholes
for their supplies, let's use that! Let's put humanity's hope on a last moment
change! :D</p>
</li>
<li><p>Olivia's powers.
You used your last <em>cortexiphan</em> -or however it's written- on revive yourself
from a headshot (LOL), then you get injected fours times, each for every
dimension swap you have to do. Despite the fact that just this sucks, there's
more: William Bell needed a lot of time just to unleash her powers, and now,
is not that she have the powers <em>active</em>, but also she knows how to swap
dimensions on her own will. Fascinating. Also, from this point Olivia don't
need fear to use her powers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The observers chip.
Peter removes a chip from a observer and the observer die. Removes it from
himself and nothing happen. And I'm not talking about how deep the chip was
jumping insinde the brain when Walter did the tests… just WTF, die already.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gun's agains the observers.
This is just a little thing: in <em>our</em> universe, Bell design some improved guns
-that apparently only the rebels have 21 years in the future…- that shoots
faster to deal with the observers. When Olivia travels to the alternative
universe, they don't have that guns but can kill observers without a problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Time travel:
Apparently there's only one shot for a single one to time-travel: September
takes it. But when he's killed nothing prevents Walter for time traveling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Olivia vs. Observer Boss.
Apparently the energy needed to move a truck with the cortexiphan powers is
the electricity of the entire New York. That's efficient use of energy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more things, I'm sure, but I don't remember just now. Besides, there's
more than enough here.</p>
