          <p>I've been using OS X for my workstation environment for about five or six
years now. I always say (and believe to this moment) that OS X is the most
comfortable environment for work.</p>
<p>It has an stable window manager, a terminal that does not suck and lot's of
software related to my daily activities. I can reinstall and have a fully
working environment from scratch in an hour or so (no hdd dupes, a full OS
installation).</p>
<p>I've been really comfortable with this for a long time, and with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-
technology/2016/03/ubuntus-bash-and-linux-command-line-coming-to-windows-10/">the last
features coming to windows</a>
I thought that it was time to refresh my GNU/Linux rants and give it a try
again like I did to Android not so long ago.</p>
<p>So, here's the deal: Starting today I'm going to spend one month on a linux
environment at work to see how it goes. I think the starting transition will
be easier since at work most of the company tools are online or done via ssh,
and my most used app is emacs and I use it directly on a terminal.</p>
<p>The chosen penguin is: <a href="https://antergos.com/">AntergOS</a> (based on <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch
Linux</a>, it simplified me the installation process)
with <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> as the window manager. I always wanted to try a
tiling <em>wm</em> so this is the best moment to do so, and Arch was my favourite OS
back at the time and I will know how to use most of the internals if it hasn't
changed a lot.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2016/04/11/penguin-trials/wallpaper.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For now I just have installed my most common apps and I haven't tuned a bit
apart from the screensaver. I'm sure this will change in no time. I will try
to make weekly or biweekly entries with updates, or if things don't get out of
control just a summary after a month.</p>
<p>Let's see how it goes!</p>
