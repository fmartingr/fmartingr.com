          <p>After a really long time I finally managed to spend some time redesigning and moving my blog to another platform, everyone already know that <a href="https://gitlab.com/fmartingr/fmartingr.com/blob/master/fmartingrcom/themes/v1/templates/blog/entry.jinja#L67">I tried really hard</a> to create an editor that satisfied me while the answer was simpler.</p>
<!-- readmore -->

<p>I like to <em>reinvent the wheel</em> (<del>I don't even know if that expression exists or it's said like that in English, let me know!</del> <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=reinvent%20the%20wheel">Apparently yes</a>) but this time I got really far... like years far: I stopped writting because I did not find any editor confortable to the point <a href="https://gitlab.com/fmartingr/fmartingr.com">I created my own blog application</a> without success. This madness has to stop, there has to be something already there for me.</p>
<p>After trying almost every blog and static content generator out there I stumbled upon <a href="/blog/2016/12/21/new-site/Lektor">https://www.getlektor.com</a>, a simple but really powerful static site generator that almost completely fit my needs.</p>
<p>After trying it a bit, I migrated the new theme I was making <a href="https://gitlab.com/fmartingr/fmartingr.com/tree/v3">in a refactor of my old site to Flask</a> (<em>yikes!</em>) and recreated the same site structure to do a final test.</p>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<p><em>But why?</em> you may ask... <em>Lektor's editor is worst that the one you made</em>.</p>
<p>And you are right, Lektor's editor is just a <code>textarea</code>, but you forget one thing: <strong>all the content are plain text files that I can edit with whatever I want</strong>.</p>
<p>Having this flexibility is awesome, most of the content of the site <a href="/made-with-open-source">is edited in either Emacs or Atom</a>. Even if it was tricky at first because Lektor creates all the content in the same path <a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/fmartingr-lektor/tree/master/content">I managed a -I'm sure overengineered- way</a> to sort the files the way I wanted. Will improve it in the future when I know more about Lektor's internals.</p>
<p>The theme also reflects the change I've been noticing in the past year: I want simplicity, so the site is as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>Just a few colors, no CSS frameworks (only a simple grid) and everything is made up from scratch. It still needs a little enhancements but it wont get much further. Also I'm sure I left a few stuff broken when I migrated all the blog entries but everything will be fixed with time.</p>
<p>I hope this gives me more time and motivation to keep writing. There are a few old drafts from tools that I'm going to finish up, and... well, more stuff that will be shared with you in future posts. :)</p>
<p>P.S.: I do not forget that I owe you the conclusion of <a href="/blog/2016/04/11/penguin-trials/">the penguin trials</a> too!</p>
