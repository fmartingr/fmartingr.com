<div class="text-center">Finally went to a good enough place to try out my drone filming skills!</div><!-- readmore -->

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2><p>Finally flied a bit with my Drone! I bought it cause a good offer came up, but here is usually very windy plus I need to go a bit far away to a flight allowed zone. And well even if it wasn't the perfect weather to film around it was very good to lose the fear to lose the drone around even when I couldn't see it because it was too far away.</p>
<p>Can't wait for better weather though! Videos have a very good quality and the shots are just amazing from up there.</p>

</div><h2 id="projects">Projects</h2><ul>
<li><p>Preparing a community given approach to <a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/switch-games-json"><strong>switch-games-json</strong></a> since the other repository I'm basing it off is not active since last year and PR suggestions are not being merged.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/fmartingr/games-screenshot-manager"><strong>games-screenshot-manager</strong></a> is going under a huge refactor since the proof of concept is working very well on my end (being using it for a few months now) so it's time to make the codebase more decent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trying out <a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo</a> as a replacement for lektor for this blog. I still need to figure out if the benefits are worth it the time investment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After doing Go for a while figured out what a pain in the ass is to deploy/containerize python applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2><ul>
<li><p>Started reading <a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/29161/star_wars_doctor_aphra_2020_-_present"><strong>Doctor Aphra (2020 - present)</strong></a></p>
<p>I like it, but my subscription ended after trying it for a month, and since I haven't seen any improvement to the app and the pages loading I'm not paying it anymore... it's $10/mo of suffering anytime I want to just read for 10 minutes. It's a shame since people made a lot of recommendations to read Marvel related things, but I'm assuming I would just end up buying the tomes physically. Wait... maybe this was Marvel's plan all along?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reading <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-gamer/list?title_no=88"><strong>The Gamer</strong></a></p>
<p>I started this a while ago and I've came back to it. Since I didn't remember where chapter I was in I just started it again. And boy I am glad... I didn't remember a thing!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reaading <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/dice/list?title_no=64"><strong>DICE</strong></a></p>
<p>Keeping the pace up a bit, I'm still far away from reaching the current episode, but it keeps getting interesting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tvshows-and-movies">TVShows and Movies</h2><ul>
<li><p>Still watching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=70195800"><strong>Suits</strong></a></p>
<p>We watch it at lunch/dinner time. Not that I'm enjoying it much anymore, but it's still way better than regular TV.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finished <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/4gglDBMx8icA"><strong>Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier</strong></a></p>
<p>Oh man, only six episodes! The show was <strong>amazing</strong>, but I feel like a couple of extra episodes wouldn't have hurt character development. And now the wait until Loki premieres on June... :(</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watched <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0K677J96WQ96K6UY6BL15O70CO/"><strong>Invincible</strong></a> season 1</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise on Amazon Prime. I'm up to date and I'm liking it, it's start a bit childish but oh boy you're up to a surprise on the first episode. It seems is based on comics as well, so how knows if I would grow impatient and just read the comics instead of waiting for the next seasons.</p>

<p>So. What is this madness Nintendo? Are you serious? Not only there's another world with both a crazy hard level to beat and an almost infinite star box, but now I'm supposed to beat every level with every character?</p>

<li><p><a href="https://rhythmheaven.fandom.com/wiki/Rhythm_Tengoku"><strong>Rhythm Tengoku (<em>リズム天国 / Rhythm Heaven</em>)</strong></a></p>
<p>So I discovered this game on a <a href="https://twitch.tv/vitiman">friend's stream</a> and I instantly fell in love. Got it second hand complete (with its box, manual and everything!). I have played various rhythm games over the years and let me tell you this one is <strong>hard</strong>. It measures your rhythm at the beginning and oh boy I'm up for a challenge here...</p>
