          <p>They tricked me.</p>
<p>I was confortably on my Atom editor when I had to open this ugly thing.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2015/07/23/emacs-day-zero/emacs-original.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I'm trying to make the change. Also, to make things easier I switched my
layout to US since all my servers have that keyboard layout but... my muscle
memory is really good, so I still miss a lot.</p>
<p>After a basic configuration yesterday, I thought that the best way to achieve
this was to change completely from one to another and that's what I've done,
work the entire day with this. At first I was slowed down a bit because I had
to configure some keybinding I was used to and install the basic addons I use
the most (and setup them emacs style), but after a short period I was <em>mostly</em>
used to the harm of my little finger. It still hurts.</p>
<p>It's a long way to go and this is only day zero but I will keep writing posts
every one or two weeks with my improvements as a newbie guide to emacs.</p>
<p>Also, my UI now looks <em>more or less</em> like this:</p>
