<p>I didn't even plan to buy this game. Seriously. I was eager to play the Link's Awakening remake that came out the same day on the Switch and was already waiting me in he mailbox. But I saw the trailer and I had to try it... just to be sure it was as absurd as it seemed.</p>
<p><em>UGS</em> is a puzzle game (which isn't very clear just by watching the trailer) and <strong>it's fun</strong> while it lasts. It made me laugh during my entire playthrough considering in which ways could I torment the poor people near my pond, and it's also good as <em>single player couch co-op</em> since my player 2 was there telling me to do this and that to solve some to-do's. We enjoyed it.</p>
<p>But there is a <u>very bad thing</u> about it: <strong>is crazy short</strong>. I finished the main "storyline" in less han two hours with only one main to-do unsolved (dammit old man!). True, the game offer more "complicated" tasks after you finish but that didn't make me want go re-play it since it was (apparently) more of the same and some with time constraints.</p>
<p>Even though, I recommend you try this game when you when an offer pops up on your preferred store.</p>
