</table><p>The last <em>Secret Novel</em> from <em>Brandon Sanderson</em>, titled <em>The Sunlit Man</em> (or <em>El hombre iluminado</em> in Spanish, the version I read). This is the most Cosmere focused novel of the four, with a lot of references to <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> series; or at least I guess so, since I haven't read any books from that series yet, though some names feel familiar.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed it, just not as much as the others to be honest. I liked the environment a lot and the idea of <span class="spoiler">a planet that can kill you easily</span> and what that means for the population of the planet, their livelihood, their interactions, ... In the end is a Space Opera <em>ala Sanderson</em>, and I don't know if I just got spoiled with <em>Tress of the Emerald Sea</em> (my favorite of the three) that I just wanted something as different. and this one being the most similar to the novels I already read from Sanderson just made it a little worse for me.</p>
<p>Even with that, I recommend fantasy/sci-fi lovers a read; it's just around 500 pages of non-stop movement, you get to the heart of the story pretty quickly and from there is just non-stop movement until you get to the outcome in the final two-three chapters.</p>
<p>And with this, the <a href="https://www.dragonsteelbooks.com/collections/the-year-of-sanderson">year of Sanderson</a> is over.</p>
