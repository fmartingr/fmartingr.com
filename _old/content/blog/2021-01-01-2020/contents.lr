What happened in 2020 in random order:

- Lost about ~15kg (~33lbs) of weight
  - I have a way more balanced diet now and do exercise almost every day, though I still like cookies maybe a bit too much.
- Started working at Red Hat as a Software Maintenance Engineer. That happened exactly one year ago now.
