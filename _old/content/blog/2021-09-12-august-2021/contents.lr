<div class="text-center">Imagine waking up to this every day... sadly it only happens on vacation.</div>

<!-- readmore -->

Really quick update since I've been either on vacation, visiting or being visited by family. Slowly going back to normal now.

## Books

- [**DICE**](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/dice/list?title_no=64)

- [**One Piece**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/57193-one-piece): Volume 41 and beyond!

- Struggling to finish [**Ruin and Rising**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14061957-ruin-and-rising)

- Finished [**Death Note: Another Note**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6612476-death-note---another-note)

  All I can say is do not bother with it. I just want to read the original saga to compensate...

## TVShows and Movies

- For lunch and dinner time [**One Piece**](https://www.crunchyroll.com/es-es/one-piece)

- Finished [**Star Wars: The Bad Batch**](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-bad-batch/4gMliqFxxqXC)

  What a finale! It was really sad to see <span class="spoiler">all that destruction on Kamino</span> directly on a show, but we all knew that happened... It didn't have me hooking (or even paying attetion sometimes) but I want to know what's in store for the next season.

## Games

- On hold with [**The legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD**](https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/Nintendo-Switch/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Skyward-Sword-HD-1923575.html)

  The controls are just awful... It's a shame because it has some interesting things in there but I just can't get on with it :(

- Started [**The legend of Zelda: The Minish Cup**](https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/Game-Boy-Advance/The-Legend-of-Zelda-The-Minish-Cap-267486.html)

  Got my geared up GameBoy Advance SP loaded for the travel, and despite the RNG regarding the luck stones this game has aged really well in my oppinion.

- Still around with [**Baba is you**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/)
