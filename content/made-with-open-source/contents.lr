Title: Made with open source software

body:

Even for a small site like this, is important to use the appropriate tools! This site was made using open source tools some of which are:

* [Atom](https://atom.io)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Lektor](https://getlektor.com)

And of course, this site "source code" [is publicly accessible on Github too](https://github.com/fmartingr/fmartingr-lektor).
