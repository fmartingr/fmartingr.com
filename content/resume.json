        "summary": "I am a curious person always eager to learn new skills. I started working with computers at the age of eight and since then I have been researching this specific field. First, I started focusing on how computers work, the different operating systems and hardware, but soon enough I discovered that my real passion is software development. I coded my first working program when I was 14 years old and ever since then I have been looking for new languages to learn and new applications to create. I consider myself a proactive person who is always looking for the best way to solve a problem.",
