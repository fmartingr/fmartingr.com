## Package Control

Essential. Install this and forget about downloading files, updating, â€¦ Choose
to use or not every other plugin, but this one is mandatory. Just install it.

## Soda theme

The best theme I've seen for SublimeText. It's really clean and elegant. Don't
forget to use it's custom colors too!

## SublimeLinter

Highlight potential errors using _lint_ programs so you can keep your code
clean.

## SublimeCode Intel

Helps with autocomplete, allows _jump-to_ and displays information of the
highlighted function on the status bar.

## SublimeRope [**Python only!**]

Add a lot of IDE-like features to python developers thanks to the rope
library.

## Git &amp; GitGutter

The first one is a tool to integrate git commands onto the command palette,
the second one inserts an icon in the gutter area whether a line has been
modified, added or removed.

## SideBarEnchancements

Add tons of functions to the sidebar contextual menu!

## AdvancedNewFile

This is the best. Create a new file just with a key combination, no popups, no
nothing. Just press `CMD`+`ALT`+`N`, write the full path -relative to your
project path- of the file you want to create and press enter.

I use some other plugins, but this is my top. Do you use other really good
plugins not listed here? Tell me!
