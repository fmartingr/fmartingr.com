      <p>Hi! I'm Felipe, and I am a developer. Whatever that is.</p>
      <p>I have been playing with code for a while now, but I also enjoy geeking around with computers, algorithms and other stuff; the less I know about it, the better! Learning new things every day is my way of life.</p>
      <p>I think that developers are like artists, writers and composers... we all make art. But we don't use strokes and colors, words or notes, we make it through code. And I really love it.</p>
      <p>If you want to get in touch, feel free to drop me a line.</p>
